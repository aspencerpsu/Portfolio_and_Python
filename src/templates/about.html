		The Loudest Megaphone is a group-collective effort to increase 
		awareness to states, villages, and cities most affected by gun-violence. The website and mobile app are designed to reach NGOs and Congress to help pass and regulate tougher restrictions and background checks on firearm purchases to customer and to expose loophole gun show purchases. Serial numbers are not enough for a preventative measure. For more information, check gunviolencearchive.org, theloudestmegaphone twitter handle, or cdn for more information to contact your local government to make a significant change. We are a joint effort with IANSA, The Brady Campaign, Coalition To Stop Gun Violence, and violence policy centre to stop domestic gun abuse from unlawful gun owners.
